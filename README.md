# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This app helps you visualize a 2D grid visualization of the following equation: `$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$`
- On the Home tab, it utilizes creating the visualization with skia canvas and `Rects`.
- On the Shader tab, I've demonstrated the use of skia Shaders for fun.


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start and run the app

   ```bash
    npx expo run
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
